# Guess Mania
This is a mobile application built with React Native that allows users to play a number guessing game. The user generates a random number, and the app's goal is to guess the correct number within a certain range.
# Features
Number Guessing: The app prompts the user to input their guess for the randomly generated number.

Feedback: After each guess, the app provides feedback to the user, indicating whether the actual number is higher or lower than their guess.

Game Over: When the app correctly guesses the number, the app displays a "Game Over" message, indicating that the user has lost the game.

Range Selection: The app gives an alert on whether the user is lying. This allows for a more challenging or easier gameplay experience.
